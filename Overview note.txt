The ipynb should contain a project with a title, introduction, comments along the way, with a final output:
I added new comments and changed the title. The ipynb contains introduction so I didn't touch that part.
I have made some changes on gragh codes so we can see the charts on Jupyter Notebook as well. I can see the charts on vs code but not on GitHub platform. I hope it's acceptable.
